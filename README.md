# OER_biodiversity
#Uses locally stored SeaTube annotation .csv files and OER dive summary .txt files.

#Imports groups of files, cleans files and extracts only the relevant information for the analysis.

#Filters for the benthic portion of each individual dive within the group.

#Planned: calculate number of unique taxa at each taxonomic level for each dive and create visualizations, to inform taxonomic distinctness analysis.

#Planned: calculate taxonomic distinctness across groups of dives and generate relevant visualizations

#Planned: other biodiversity metrics
