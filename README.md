# OER biodiversity analysis
Uses locally stored SeaTube annotation .csv files and OER dive summary .txt files.

Imports groups of files, cleans files and extracts only the relevant information for the analysis.

Filters for the benthic portion of each individual dive within the group.

Calculates number of unique taxa at each taxonomic level for each dive and creates visualizations, to inform taxonomic distinctness analysis.

Planned: calculate taxonomic distinctness across groups of dives and generate relevant visualizations

Planned: other biodiversity metrics
